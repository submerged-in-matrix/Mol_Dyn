# Lennard-Jones 2D Molecular Dynamics (LAMMPS vs Python)

This project reproduces a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones (LJ) system using two independent implementations:
- A custom Python MD code (`lj2d.py`)
- A corresponding LAMMPS input script (`in.lj2d`)

The goal is to verify physical consistency between both simulations‚Äîenergy conservation, temperature evolution, and structural properties such as the radial distribution function *g(r)*.

## üîß Simulation Overview

| Property | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| Units | Reduced Lennard-Jones (`Œµ = œÉ = 1`) |
| Dimensions | 2D |
| Number of particles | 36 |
| Density (œÅ) | 0.8 |
| Cutoff radius | 2.5 œÉ |
| Integration timestep | 0.005 |
| Initial temperature | 1.0 |
| Ensemble | NVE |

The LAMMPS script reproduces the same setup as the Python code, including the lattice initialization, pair potential parameters, and neighbor list configuration.
